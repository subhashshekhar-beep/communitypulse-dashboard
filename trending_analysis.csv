What is Actually Happening in Nepal ?? Misinformation by Indian Media.,5223,263,1757340392.0,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1nboonh/what_is_actually_happening_in_nepal/,"Hello to my fellow neighbors in India.
I am a **Nepali citizen** living near the border, connected to both our countries not only geographically but also culturally. That is why I feel it is my duty to share the truth with you about what is really happening here.

You may have seen headlines claiming that Nepal is facing **“mass protests led by Gen Z against social media ban.”**
That is only a half-truth.

**Here is the real sequence of events:**

- Three days ago, the Nepal government suddenly banned 26 social media platforms including Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, YouTube, and Reddit.

- They claimed it was about registration and taxes. But these companies are already registered and paying taxes. The real motive is censorship: giving the government power to control online information, delete posts critical of them within 24 hours, and jail those who speak up.

- In the next two days, criticism exploded across the country. A date was set—September 8—for nationwide protests. But it was never just about social media. That ban was only the spark.


**Our patience had already run out.**

Soon, the “**Nepo Babies**” trend erupted in Nepal. It exposed the lavish lifestyles of politicians’ children—designer (clothes,bags, watches, attire )worth lakhs, luxury cars, million-rupee homes, weekly international flights, and even private jets—while ordinary Nepalis struggle daily for survival. Our PM has a salary less than 65k INR but what is owns is in million of $$$.

>This hit a nerve.
 Because Nepal has been under one form of tyranny or another for decades. From monarchy to so-called democracy, corruption and instability have never left us. Not a single prime minister has completed a full term in over 20 years.

[The protests were organized in the name of Gen Z, but they welcomed everyone. We were not just protesting a social media ban. We were standing against corruption, nepotism, tyranny, suppression, and decades of betrayal. In a country of just 30 million people, every single day around 5,000 youths leave to work abroad because there are no jobs, no decent pay, and no basic livelihood at home.]

And then the tragedy struck. Today, during the protest, I witnessed & carried something I will never forget. A 15-year-old schoolboy, still in uniform, was shot in the head by security forces—acting on orders from a minister. He was not the only one. Reports say more than 20 people have been killed, thousands injured, and the true numbers are being hidden.

I came home with blood still on my hands, only to see Indian news channels spinning a completely false narrative. They claimed it was all about social media and mocked our youths as being “**addicted**” to it. That angered me, but it didn’t surprise me. I know how the media can twist things.

That is why I am writing this here, to let you know the truth from the ground.

Hi. I'm a foreigner stuck in Delhi. Need help to get outta here.,669,111,1757379471.0,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1nc5b92/hi_im_a_foreigner_stuck_in_delhi_need_help_to_get/,"Hi. Here is my story.  It is a long one, so, if you wanna read it takes  take your seat. Hope I can find some real help here. At least this is the purpose of this post.

Im Russian guy, 26 yo, I am from Ukraine border myself originally (Taganrog,  Rostov region. It is 20km away from the Ukraine,  you can google map it if u like), and I came to India in the beginning of the war, for safety reasons. Got a student visa, to study yoga and vedic culture, and its extendable, I extended once but couldnt do it second time (there was a whole another long story. But I did not intentionally overstay here, cause I obviously didn't want to break immigration laws). So visa started to expire, then started to overstay. I didnt go back that time cause of low income (spent last everything just to relocate to India, cause was afraid of draft.)and because of forceful drafts that were going on that time (late 2022). So I had to live there, in WB, with no valid visa for a while. Again, its not thatbi wanted to overstay, I just could not prolong it. There was, unfortunately, a reason for it.

Then, on top of all that I lost my passport and documents. I got robbed basically, and whole backpack with all my docs, my military certificate, my old phone, was gone. I had to come to delhi for seeking help from my embassy. 

I came to Delhi months and MONTHS ago to get help from my embassy, but they are not VERY much helpful. (Cant expect much from Russian govt structures, if they send their own citizens to fight and die in Ukraine only for their political and economic interests.)

My embassy is KIND OF helping me, but only by giving me a temporary flight document. They dont provide neither place to stay, nor flight tickets eventhough they understand that I have no support from neither my family members, nor from old friends or anything. My own mom was informed as soon as my passport got stolen, and we asked her to send money for flight tickets and for paying my fine to frro (i didnt have money that moment. I was selling books and was only getting enough money to get by) , but she refused, although she had money. She hung up the phone on me, saying that she ""loves me"", although she was informed that i may get into serious difficulties without her urgent help. I never talked to noone from my family eversince... I always had bad relationships w them, but now i just feel as if I have no family. Anyways... 

 I'm stuck mostly because of insufficient funds and second reason is that I need to get a paper from FRRO (foreign regional registration office, or Indian bureau of immigration) called exit permit to be able to flight back. They are not giving it to me for months now. ""Your case is difficult"" , they say.

One reason for it also is that I cannot give them any residence proof document, (called C form). And that is because I literally cannot rent ANY place whatsoever. I had to live in the railway station, in the waiting area for so long that it just drove me crazy. I lost hell lot of my weight and nervous cells there. They allowed me to stay there cause i explained to local that no hostels, hotels, or landlords allow me without passport. And papers from my embassy are not working at all on them. So its a vicious circle.

At the end, when one member of their staff (just a cleaner guy) stabbed me there in the arm during the fight (he picked it), police of that new delhi railway station, pf1, just decided to throw me away because I wanted to file an FIR ( that could convince my russian embassy to finally help me with something). They didnt want to fire that guy who stabbed me, and didnt want any trouble or any scandal, so they just kicked me out. so i had to just roam around, from 1 place to another, for months after that. This is my situation even now. 

Embassy guys did look concerned when they saw me with my arm bleeding but couldnt do much still. They do not provide neither place to stay, nor, again, are very active in helping me to return back. I mean, they do whatever is there in the script of their job, and I can see that its NOT that much. :/

So, back to the exit permit... I have no passport and visa to rent any flat or room or hotel or hostel, and I need a document from the house/hostel owner, and without that document I cannot get exit permit feom FRRO🤦‍♂️. At least I cannot get it easily. That may be one of the main reasons why they take way too long in my case. I explained all of it to them ofc, and 1 worker there seemed to be understanding my situation and she offered me some way that MAY work even in the absence of C form, but she was the only 1 in the whole structure who really were getting me and understanding my situation. So its going extremely slow and dull. 
 
Now I am in the process of getting that exit permit, but it takes extremely long. I may have a chance of getting it still, I believe I just need to push them more, like, make some final push, so to speak, but I have very difficult time doing it while I am having to just always be in a constant search for place to stay, food, medicines and other bare necessities. I was hosted by few indians here in delhi, but noone can do it for long time, which is understandable. Still I need a place to stay for at least 1 or 2 months, to finalise my docs and be ready for a flight. 

Last time I got some nice place i was hosted by a guy from Meghalaya, but he had to fly to his hometown for his uni studies. And I am in the IGIA airport, in the waiting room for last 4 days as Im writing this. I have no money, and only survive here cause that guy from Meghalaya sends me something for water and some food. Rn I have 2 rs in the pocket. Couldn't contact him this evening.

Really, really hope to get some support here on reddit. At least i should try anything I can. Im a real person and this story is too. You can come meet me in IGIA in waiting area, to get to know me closer, or write me here, or by links in my profile. Even you can call my russian embassy and ask them if they know me (I'll give you my name), everyone will surely recognise me. From the phone operator up to the head of the embassy, i think. 

So why im writing here... Im trying to find some host here, even for a few days or a week, or cpl weeks. or, better, to find someone who can help me get any kind of flat, at least for 1 2 months. I need help to finalise my document shit and get back to my country. Any help with getting 

Please reach out to me if something can be done. 

P.s. yes, I tried gurdwaras. They ask for document and the only thing free there is a place on the balcony (on the street basically) and a mat. I tried living in temple too, cant do it no more. What else... yes, NGOs are also asking for documents, however paradoxal it may sound, and don't allow a foreigner w no documents in. Yes, I filed a lost report about my documents and all. No, police does not help, I spoke with too many of them. No, I cannot just get a job here (without documents) , and I don't want to be engaged in scamming or drug dealing. If there would be some other option which would work, id accept it. Didnt see any so far. 

So this is my only option rn - simply ask for help in resolving this. I am posting and writing everyone I can in my insta, in my contact list and so on - but no response at all. 

Pray and Hope this message finds someone who really would care. 🙏 

Thank you for your attention. If anything - please check my profile page. Reach me here or in insta/telegram . Any help appreciated, however insignificant. 

P.p.s: Idk why I cant attach photos here, but i do have scans of some documents and some other things to show. I uploaded them on my profile. Please visit and check",2025-09-09T00:57:51+00:00,0.2099435898594834,0.08,0.7908,0.2915556427351815,0.6602783866640082,36.15

I had such a wholesome experience today,11,2,1757402709.0,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1nccfkx/i_had_such_a_wholesome_experience_today/,"So I was on my way to my office when my petrol ran out, for the very first time, due to the festivals last few days I didn't really paid any attention to it.

So today on my way when the petrol ran out I tried so hard to get my vehicle running, but it just wouldn't start, then a nice man, of maybe 50 came and helped me, trying to kick start, helping me accelerate and what not, but it didn't help, since there was no petrol, I thanked him and asked him to go since he was getting late for his own office.

The nearby petrol pump was 1.5 km away and I had to push my maestro till there, initially that was the plan, I was exhausted halfway through, because I had my laptop bag behind me and a hevay vehicle I was pushing on a crowded road, it was very difficult.

Then halfway through I stopped pushing to gather my breath near Shivganga temple near me, I was just calculating the distance I have to go when suddenly two boys, maybe 24-26 year came to me and asked me what was the problem.

When I told them about how I had ran out of petrol and was going towards the petroleum they immediately offered to push my vehicle until there, I cannot explain how relieved I felt then, it was as if the God himself came to help me, and I won't lie I was literally standing outside Shivganga Mandir, I was almost on the verge of crying because I was never stuck in situations like this ever, I always filled my tank before time, and this was the first time I forgot.

So when we reached the petrol pump, the petrol pump was closed, but they didn't leave me there, they pushed my vehicle until the next petrol pump came up and then only left when they knew I was fine, I can never thank God enough for sending them.

This day!! I'm never going to forget, these people came to help me without anything in return, it was just so wholesome that I couldn't wait to share it with you'll.",2025-09-09T07:25:09+00:00,0.035776239226730636,0.0,0.7374499999999999,0.3041487654581208,0.9586412956665127,32.78

Living in india is just exhausting honestly.,2203,280,1757332434.0,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1nblnic/living_in_india_is_just_exhausting_honestly/,"Where do I even begin. Honestly I feel it's just exhausting to really live in this country.

Infra is just pathetic. 9-5 jobs are actually 7-10 if you consider the time it takes to commute in metro cities. And when you do get home, you can't even have some quiet time because someone is doing a kirtan with loud music on. 

You can't go outside because there aren't enough public parks or walkable spaces. And if you do happen to live nearby one, then either the road will be dug out or you just won't go outside because pollution.

When it's raining you just have to pray that you don't get into an open manhole or you get in vicinity of live wire.

They say to escape India in India you need to buy a place in gated societies. But wait, can you even afford a home in these gated societies ? Majority of the Middle class with even IT Benchmark salary cannot afford to buy home in this country. 

And even if you can, you still can't escape the terrible Air Quality and the pathetic infra.

Job security doesn't exist in India, and if you're born in General category then basically you are on your own. The taxes you pay get you nothing in this country.

From birth till death life is just a rat race in this country.

Technically the most poor and unequal nation with the most misleading statistics on the planet.,5,0,1757404543.0,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1nccvt3/technically_the_most_poor_and_unequal_nation_with/,"**TL;DR:** India may be the *5th largest economy*, but the ***average income*** of **\~$2,500** is **skewed** by the rich. The ***median Indian*** makes only **\~$500 a year.** Remove the top 10%, and the rest average just \~$1,300, lower than Sub-Saharan Africa’s \~$1,650. Meanwhile, the top 1% grabs 22% of all income and holds 40% of the wealth. The “low inequality” Gini score of 25 is misleading because it measures spending, not income, real income Gini is \~**40–50**, and wealth inequality (Gini by wealth) is above **80**. Astonishing.

“5th largest economy”. But the reality is very different.

* The **average income we hear about (\~₹2 lakh / $2,500 a year)** is just a mathematical **mean**. It’s pulled up by a small number of very rich people.
* The **real middle Indian (the median)** makes only about **₹40,000 a year (\~$500)**. That means half the population lives on **even less**.
* If you remove the richest 10% from the data, the **remaining 90% average only about $1,300 a year**. That’s actually lower than the average in Sub-Saharan Africa at **$1,650/year**.
* At the same time, the **top 1% of Indians takes 22% of all the income and controls 40% of total wealth**.

And here’s why inequality looks smaller on paper than in real life: the **Gini index** that gets quoted for India (around 25) is **misleading**. That number doesn’t measure **income inequality**, it measures **consumption inequality** (how much people spend). Since rich people save and invest most of their money instead of reporting it as spending, the gap looks artificially small. The government leans on this low Gini number to say India is “equal,” but independent studies that measure **actual incomes** put India’s **Gini closer to 40–50**. If you measure **wealth**, the **Gini shoots past 80**. So on official charts India looks as equal as Scandinavia, but on the ground it’s closer to Latin America

Traumatized,53,7,1757360806.0,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1nbxsv0/traumatized/,"M29, Spent 28 years of my life Mumbai Chaw. I have only witnessed fight and argument at home throughout my childhood. Did attempt suicide back in 2007/08 as i was always been blamed for any fights back home. 

My dad is married to two women's, we used to live under single roof. He married my mom as his first wife was unable concieve and actually cheated both. Mom had ran away to marry him and could not go back to her family after knowing the truth.

Somewhere in late secondary school, I witnessed my mom paying off mobile and electricity bill of some third person while travelling to grandparents house, I was a kid back then and could not process things properly.

Always heard my dad blaming my mother of cheating on him with some third person and my dad used to be drunk almost every single day.

2015/2016 : I was scrolling through mom's phone and saw transaction with 2 lacs and came across message where someone else had promised to double the money in a month or so. Person was pretending to me some sort of CEO based out ok UK and I quickly checked his number on truecaller and found very Desi Indian name and did informed my mom about the same and she shrugged it off.

My only mistake was to not inform dad to avoid quarrels and verbal abuse at home

What followed was disaster, My mom was trapped and had transferred lacs to different unknown accounts by borrowing/ taking loans/ selling off her gold and affair at the same time, possibly with multiple people to arrange money. 

Lately night fights, dad abusing her verbally, slapping her, got her hand fractured. Saw cops coming at our door at night and walk of shame from our area where asked me to manage things at home as i was eldest of all siblings.

Slowely things started falling in place, Dad came to collusion that someone from his side had spelled a black magic on our family to destroy it. Though, I never believed it.

Post covid; before 2023 - We again caught mom having affair with someone else and again transactions of money.

November 2023 - Saw a transaction of 1lac to someone, what followed was false statements and lies. Eventually called up the person and I abused him and vent our my frustration. Informed my gf about it as i had to vent it out, however her anxiety re triggered and we Eventually parted our ways as he dad found out it was due to our relationship.

Fast forward 2024 - Met my now wife, through arranged marriage setup. She accepted my family situation. Dad married to two women's, all Living under same roof in chawl. I am earning well and we decided to purchase a 2bhk by 2026 and move out with entire family. She did not want to break our family as i am the only son

My own younger sister stopped to talking to me out of nowhere and then did not talk to my wife. My dad always supported my sister.

Got married earlier this year and my dad's first wife started a fight on third day of marriage. Wife was hospitalised due to anxiety attack after 15 days of marriage 

Eventually decided to move out with my wife and mom, however caught my mom twice now in last couple of month and have asked her to stay with her mother as we can't tolerate this forever. 

To make things worse, We lost our 2 months twin fetus yesterday.

It has been a emotional Rollercoaster for me and my wife.",2025-09-08T19:46:46+00:00,0.008543972386756242,0.12000000000000002,0.8494999999999999,0.33057569863243774,0.4894000459363544,28.79

My Opinion on growing hate towards INDIANS,228,92,1757333899.0,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1nbm5u2/my_opinion_on_growing_hate_towards_indians/,"A fellow Bihari here from Siwan district. My village and district played a very significant role in India’s independence. Many top freedom fighters and INC leaders came from my area people who rose above caste and religion to join the freedom struggle. One of them later became the first President of independent India yes, I am talking about Dr. Rajendra Prasad. My own great-grandfather served in the Indian National Army led by Subhash Chandra Bose, and he was jailed in Burma in his last years of service. There were so many freedom fighters and leaders that if I start talking about all of them, this whole conversation would turn into that topic.

You might be wondering why I am telling you this. Because exactly six months ago a trend started on the ""INDIAN"" internet with slogans like ""Delete Bihar from India"", ""Give Bihar to China and take Kashmir"", ""Ek Bihari 100 B!m@ari"", ""Biharis are B!m@ris"", ""Biharis Don't have Civic sense"", and so on. At that time I sank into such deep depression that I could not even talk about it. Shaming an entire community because of one or two incidents that’s a brilliant thing to do for us ""INDIANS"". I was wondering: did our freedom fighters free India for us to see days like this? Did our state somehow fail in the independence movement? Did we play a smaller role than others? Yes, I admit there are faults in our state, but my state was not always like this. Manipulative politics and caste politics have damaged it. I agree that issues like migration, education, and unemployment exist in my state; these issues are being raised today and work is being done on them.

But the kind of hate I saw for my state back then was just insane. To be honest, at that time I didn’t even feel Indian.

I had been waiting for days like these… The same kind of hate that ""INDIANS"" gave to a part of their own country or to a community, today foreigners are giving the same or even more to ""INDIANS"". To be frank, I now feel ashamed to defend my country, and I don’t want to. The anti-Indian immigration movements in Australia and other countries show that what Bihar is to India is what India is to the world. Those who have never been abroad and live only in an echo chamber screaming ""Ayye Bihari..."" in cities like Delhi and Mumbai while thinking themselves superior may not realize how much hatred Indians face overseas. Just as Indians show hatred toward Biharis, foreigners show even more hatred toward Indians and that has been going on for a long time. What looks like harassment and rage-baiting on the internet is, on the ground, horrific racism and discrimination against Indians. Those who consider themselves superior should read how European powers discriminated against INDIANS before independence.

When we are not even united among ourselves, someone else will take advantage of it, won’t they? When foreigners call us ""P@jeet"", do they check whether you are Dravidian, North Indian, Marathi, or Bengali? My question is to you:

If an Indian is attacked abroad today, will you defend them after checking their region? Over to you.

Why don’t men understand this simple thing that posts like these create hate and increases cases like these? Rape is a very big issue that the society collectively needs to tackle. Whether a bird or a dog or a small kid or an elderly women sometimes even their own mom isn’t spared. 
When will women in India be safe? Feeling safe in my own country is a huge question right now and why do men think that women have it all or women have it easy. My friend if we come home safe even from work we have to thank god that we aren’t raped.

My parents are ruining my life,17,10,1757350292.0,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1nbt1lv/my_parents_are_ruining_my_life/,"Hey everyone, I don’t usually post here but I really need to get this off my chest. I’ve been struggling a lot with speech coordination problems for as long as I can remember. It’s become so hard that I can’t form friendships easily. I feel awkward and scared to talk, and people don’t understand. In college, I mostly stay in my room alone because it’s exhausting to try and socialize when my words don’t come out right. I’m falling behind in studies and feel like I’m being left out while everyone else is moving forward.

On top of that, I’ve been dealing with OCD and some other mental health issues. It feels like my brain is constantly overthinking and stuck in patterns I can’t control. I’ve tried telling my parents, but they don’t really take it seriously. They took me to some cheap doctor who just scolded me for talking about it, making me feel even more helpless. I’ve lost confidence and motivation. My dreams seem so far away now — I’m just trying to survive from one day to the next, scared about what’s going to happen.

I feel so alone. No friends to talk to, no support, and it’s affecting my studies and career goals. I want to do something meaningful, but right now, it feels like I’m stuck in a loop of anxiety, fear, and loneliness. I’m scared about the future and I don’t know how to get out of this.",2025-09-08T16:51:32+00:00,0.006125779170196163,0.04,0.803925,0.31535218035839147,0.41342757202886105,25.38

In India having decent human beings as parents is like winning the lottery.,145,15,1757356929.0,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1nbw2ot/in_india_having_decent_human_beings_as_parents_is/,"We are taught to obey our parents without question and follow their instructions on what to eat, what to study, what to do for work, who to be friends with, who to wed and have sex with, and when to have children. Think about it, more than 90% of marriages (as per a 2018 survey) are arranged. The vast majority of couples had to have sex with a stranger chosen by their family. I know a lot of you will say that you were allowed to say no to a someone you didn't like or spend time getting to know the other person. You, however, form a minority. And even these choices are ultimately dictated by your loved ones. They're fine with their child picking from a shortlist which aligns with the parameters of caste, religion, food habits and financial status.

As adults, Indians look upon the time when they were physically abused with humor and nostalgia, because this is something that is normalized in Indian society. I don't know anyone who didn't get slapped around, caned or beaten with footwear as a child. And even though Indians consider this a normal part of growing up, the impact of such violence is all around us to see - road rage, people yelling at each other in public, elder abuse, the celebration of violence inflicted on vulnerable groups and cycles of domestic violence. I believe riots and communal violence are a manifestation of the trauma of childhood violence. When a child learns that the consequence of a mistake is pain and suffering, as an adult he uses this logic to inflict harm on communities he believes to have wronged him. We need to ask ourselves about what kind of a person chooses to hurt a defenseless child. Their home is the only shelter available to a child, and yet people choose to turn that safe space into a site of pain and fear for them.

We look around us in society, and we come across people who disrespect and harass women, lack any modicum of civic sense, are bigoted towards their fellow citizens, pay bribes, use their influence to break rules, commit tax fraud and victimize those they have power over. All of them will one day end up having a partner found for them, and then having children. Society will expect their progeny to respect their mother and father as living gods. Don't mistake such people for the minority. It will make the skin of women crawl to know how boys from ordinary families discuss their bodies and lives when they are among themselves. I have seen it first-hand right from school to one of the best colleges in the country right down to the workplace. Tax fraud is second nature to those running businesses. I had a a really rich friend in college who showed a lot of respect towards his family. He would touch their feet every time he left home. However, when demonetization hit, he was calling up his friends to figure out how to convert their cash. His father works in an ordinary government job. It never occurred to him to think of his father as a criminal who is betraying his country. To my friend he remains a figure worthy of reverence.

This is because we are not taught empathy, decency, honesty, conscientiousness, politeness or civic sense at home. Our values dictate obedience, deference to elders and maintaining caste purity. It is okay to litter outside, harass women in public (boys being boys), take bribes or yell at people, as long as you keep your home clean, ensure your sister and female cousins are modest (and virgins), are honest in your financial dealings with your family, and are respectful to your elders. Being respectful to elders among your relatives or caste group does not extend to showing respect to the elderly sanitation worker or laborer working outside your house. He's to be treated with a firm hand because he's unworthy of respect. No matter how old that person, he's to be called *bhaiya*, never *uncle* or *sir*. You will never touch the feet of an elderly servant no matter how many years they've cared for you and your family. To do so would be an extremely embarrassing faux pas.

Given all this, it shouldn't be any surprise that Indian society is the way it is. When we are taught that there is no bigger crime than falling in love with the wrong person, when we learn that you are supposed to leave decency at home, we are taught to hate and look down on others rather than respect all people no matter their differences then there is going to be corruption, violence, a lack of civic sense, honor killings, rapes, and bigotry. No matter who you elect, how strict you make your laws, how assiduously you report these crimes, they will never go away unless you change Indian society as a whole. Even our solutions are a reflection of our internalized violence. Even here, when we see news of a rape or murder, people start demanding castrations, home demolitions, fake encounters, lynchings, torture and death sentences, not realizing that this demand for inhumane punishment may perhaps be arising from the same source as the motives for those crimes - that hurting others makes us feel better about the world we live in.

Recently, the automatic toll system of a Japanese company crashed for 38 hours. Rather than have this choke traffic, the company opened the toll gate and allowed people to just drive past. More than 21,000 commuters still chose to voluntarily pay the toll online. Tolls in Japan are expensive because the government wants people to use public transport. There was no penalty for non-payment and all uncollected tolls were waived off. Still thousands of people chose to pay. Instead of tooting our horn as a purported superpower perhaps we should learn from others and envision a better way of life.",2025-09-08T18:42:09+00:00,0.019123983271221633,0.16,0.572225,0.28560094683350284,0.459883636996099,24.26

Kept digging and now I’m lost in thoughts about the world debt !,10,10,1757355207.0,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1nbvav0/kept_digging_and_now_im_lost_in_thoughts_about/,"It started simple. I was just thinking how D2C startups are still selling with discounts, cashbacks, freebies. Basically burning money and not profitable since decades.

Then I thought okay, how long can they do this? Maybe until investors stop funding them. But wait, where do those investors keep getting money from?

So I dug deeper. Investors get it from bigger funds, pension money, governments, whatever. But even they don’t have endless cash, right? They also borrow. From banks. And banks borrow from central banks. And central banks just print more.

And now it feels like every layer I peel, it all connects back to one giant thing: WORLD DEBT. Like the entire system is just swimming in borrowed money.

Then another thought hit me, why is the world creating so much debt? Why does it never stop? Why does it never go back to “normal”?

And if this is really how it works… maybe the world, the infrastructure, the lifestyle we see around us today, was never supposed to look like this naturally. Maybe everything we call “growth” is just running on borrowed time.

"Kids misbehave, parents scroll:repeat,after Covid this is reality",17,2,1757342574.0,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1nbplhj/kids_misbehave_parents_scrollrepeatafter_covid/,"Why do parents nowadays just try to cover up their children’s faults?

In my colony, there is a group of children between 7–12 years old, and honestly, they are so poorly parented. Since there’s no playground nearby, the kids usually play on the streets. The road is usually deserted and wide enough for people to walk and for kids to play.

Just for starters,this evening, I was coming back from my coaching class. One of my friends wanted to ask me something, so we stood at the roadside, and the road was completely empty. A girl was cycling there, and just to show off in front of her friends, she started calling me “auntie, bhabhi,chick , chikky, whoever you are, just go to the side” (I was literally already standing at the side). All her friends laughed. I ignored it, thinking they were just trying to look cool and they’re kids, so why should I reply?

But later, when I started walking home again, she came once more on her bicycle and repeated the same thing. This time, she deliberately tried to swerve me off the roadside, where an open drain was. I almost lost balance, so I grabbed her bicycle and stopped her. Immediately, she started swearing. I was already mentally exhausted after coaching, so I just said, “It wouldn’t do you any harm to be respectful to others. The road is completely empty, so there’s no need to push someone aside.” Her mother happened to be nearby, and instead of scolding her daughter, she started shouting at me as if I was the one swearing. I explained the whole situation, but she didn’t listen.

And these kinds of incidents happen almost daily. For example, one of my friends was coming back from her tuition when a boy deliberately aimed a Cosco ball at her backpack. Inside was her phone, and the screen broke. When she told him, “You broke my screen,” he laughed and said, “Now you won’t be able to make reels.” The irony is, my friend doesn’t even make reels. Later, when she complained to his mother, the mother kept denying it. Even after seeing the CCTV footage from a nearby shop, she said, “My son likes to joke, don’t take it seriously.”

They even openly body shamed once, when an overweight lady was passing by, and they started singing “Booty, booby, booty,booby…” in a singsong. They also shout the same slangs we usually see on social media, but they do it openly on the streets without any hesitation, as if being disrespectful makes them look “cool.” and many ppl don't know know eng so they don't get wth kids are reciting 

I don’t think it’s really the kids’ fault:it’s their parents. The parents themselves are addicted to their mobiles, they hardly spend time parenting, and on top of that, they hand over mobiles to their kids, making them addicted too. Kids now behave as if they are living in a virtual world, always trying to impress their friends. Parents don’t even recognize their faults anymore, let alone correct them.

One of my cousins is a primary school teacher and has taught in multiple reputed schools. She says the same thing: after COVID, parents don’t want to take responsibility. If a teacher points out their child’s bad behaviour, many parents shout as if they sent their kids to school and it’s the school’s sole responsibility to teach good behaviour.

Just a few years back, I also played with my friends on the same street. We were a group of 25, and they are a group of 15 now. But we never tried to make others’ lives miserable, and our parents always recognized and corrected our mistakes. Things have really changed.",2025-09-08T14:42:54+00:00,0.0018360446551075771,0.08,0.7188749999999999,0.31149584881107373,0.36527352721377426,23.76

I had a really bad experience with a Rapido driver (Ride ID: **RD17571636413425869**).

* The total ride fare was only **₹676**, but the driver insisted I pay **₹900**.
* I tried paying online (₹900 twice), but at that time the payment didn’t confirm due to a bank server issue.
* To avoid delay, I also paid **₹900 cash** directly to the driver.
* Later, both online payments got confirmed, meaning I ended up paying **₹2700** in total (₹1800 extra).
* I have **proof**: bank confirmation, screenshot of payment, photo of the car plate, and even a video of me handing over the cash.

After realizing the double payment, I messaged the driver to return my ₹1800. Instead of cooperating, he started ignoring my calls and messages. I even warned him that I would lodge an FIR under **IPC Sections 406 & 417** and report his vehicle to the RTO for blacklisting under the **Motor Vehicles Act**. Still no response.

This is pure **cheating and misappropriation of money**. I’m shocked how drivers misuse trust like this.

**What I want to know:**

* Has anyone faced something similar with Rapido?
* What’s the fastest way to get my money back – should I go to the police directly or push through Rapido support?
* Can RTO really blacklist his car if I file a complaint?

Any advice will help. I don’t want others to fall into the same trap.

Need Advice: Education Loan Refinancing in India (14% Interest at DCCB Bank),5,2,1757329469.0,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1nbkpxn/need_advice_education_loan_refinancing_in_india/,"Hey everyone,

I’m in a really tough spot right now and would appreciate any guidance.

I had taken an education loan of around ₹45 lakhs from DCCB Bank for my studies in the US. Unfortunately, I had to return to India and now I’m struggling to manage the repayment. The loan is at a 14% interest rate, which is brutal.

I recently got a job with a monthly salary of around ₹80,000, but my EMI itself is ₹65,000. I don’t own any property, and my father is set to retire in the next 3 years, which makes things even more stressful. Honestly, I’ve been losing sleep over this.

A senior suggested that some Indian banks offer education loan refinancing at lower interest rates. I have no clear idea about the process or which banks I should approach.

Could anyone here guide me with:
	•	Which banks in India currently provide education loan refinancing?
	•	What’s the typical process for transferring/refinancing an education loan?
	•	Any tips to make the application stronger (since I don’t have collateral)?

I’m also planning to upskill further and maybe look for freelance projects on platforms like Upwork to create an extra income stream. But for now, my priority is getting out of this crushing interest trap.

Any step-by-step instructions or experiences would be very helpful.

Thanks in advance.

Then the 90s came, the same old tropes were still being overused, but new stars and directors started their careers and atleast gave a breath of fresh air, the Khans, Anurag Kashyap, had their starts, but alas, by the 2000s, the industry had went the same way as the 80s and started copying scripts from across the seas, taking hit hollywood and other cinemas movies and passing it off of their own.

The window for new actors without any major backgrounds to make it big in bollywood also closed, with nepotism reigning supreme. Fast forward to now, Bollywood is a sham, zero creativity left and majority of the movies are made for one sole purpose - for the stars to make money and increase their families net worth more than it already is.

Beware of Hypexstitch brand,4,1,1757342176.0,india,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1nbpfim/beware_of_hypexstitch_brand/,"I'm sharing this based on my personal experience with hypexstitch.in. They are a clothing brand who make embroidered anime merchandise i.e tshirts and hoodies. I came across their insta account and was fairly impressed with the products. They don't have a ton of followers, as their oldest post was that of 2nd April '25. I spoke to their representative over whatsapp and gained confidence in ordering my first product. 
Mistake 1- should've checked that all their posts had very little to no engagement whatsoever.

Since I ordered a custom embroidered hoodie, i had to pay the entire cost of 3499/- upfront.
Mistake 2 - should've done more research before shelling out the money, since I couldn't find any 
review for this brand.

22 days have passed since the payment, and they have no updates on my order. Most of the days they choose to ignore my messages, and on others they make false promises.
The reasons they are providing for delay are pathetic. Sometimes it's their high order volume, sometimes it's procurement issue and sometimes they are just not well.

The money I've spent is gone and I've very little hope of getting the actual product.
